# Hecatia
Cryptography practice. Three functions that generate a key for, encrypt, and decrypt data.

##What and Why
How it works is simple: a key is generated; the first five digits of it are the length (in characters) of the string or data, and the rest are the locations of each bit of data. Junk data is added to surround the real data.

I wanted to get some practice in, so Hecatia (named after the touhou character - just kidding, the greek god of witchcraft) was created.
